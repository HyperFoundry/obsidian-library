# Obsidian Library Builder Script (for QuickAdd plugin)

## Demo & Screenshots
Screenshots coming soon! Please refer to installation guide below

## üì∞ Description
This script allows you to quickly search for books and build a book tracker/library in Obsidian. For use in conjunction with [Quickadd plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) by @chhoumann, search and create new book notes with a complete selection of metadata fields sourced from [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/) (no API key needed!) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). 

I plan to add additional metadata sources such as: 
- Open Library API
- Amazon.com / Kindle
- New York Times Books API

I plan to add additional metadata fields & features:
- pricing details
- other book editions &  links to other book editions
- search by: print type (ie. book, ebook, kindle, etc.), publisher, lccn/oclc ID
- may turn this into a full fledged plugin
