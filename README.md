# QuickAdd script for adding books to your Obsidian vault

## Demo
**Demo & Screenshots coming soon!**

## Description
This script allows you to easily add a book note with a wide range of metadata fields to your Obsidian vault using [Quickadd plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) by @chhoumann.

The script queries the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/) (no API key needed!) and scrapes [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) for metadata related to your book.

## Disclaimer
I am new to programming. I welcome any and all feedback. I am not responsible for any damage caused by the use of this script. I have commented the script thoroughly to help others understand it.

The script is inspired by [QuickAdd - Movie And Series Script](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd/blob/master/docs/Examples/Macro_MovieAndSeriesScript.md) by @chhoumann and the [QuickAdd - Books Script](https://github.com/Elaws/script_googleBooks_quickAdd) by @Elaws

**Please never run a script that you don't understand. Remember to make regular backups of your Obsidian's vault!**
